# Hangman-Project
Hangman is a guessing game. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. In this project we will be playing Hangman with the computer. The computer will randomly pick from a set of words and the user will have to guess letters till they figure it out.
